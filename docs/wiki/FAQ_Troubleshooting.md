## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: The PoKeys device is not detected by LinuxCNC.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure that the PoKeys device is properly connected to the RaspberryPi4 or other supported hardware.
2. Verify that the necessary drivers and dependencies are installed.
3. Check the device connection using the `lsusb` command to ensure it is recognized by the system.
4. Restart the LinuxCNC service and check the logs for any error messages.

### Issue 2: Digital inputs/outputs are not functioning as expected.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the pin configuration in the HAL file to ensure the correct pins are assigned for digital inputs/outputs.
