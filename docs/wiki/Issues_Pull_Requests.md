# Issues and Pull Requests

## Cross-linking to Issues and Pull Requests

Where appropriate, cross-link to relevant **Issues** or **Pull Requests**. This helps provide context and additional information for certain bug fixes or features. Here are some guidelines for cross-linking:

### Cross-linking to Issues

1. **Bug Fixes**: If a certain bug fix has documentation associated with it, link back to the issue for more context.
2. **Feature Requests**: If a new feature has been implemented, link back to the feature request issue.
3. **Troubleshooting**: If a troubleshooting guide addresses a specific issue, link to that issue for more details.

### Cross-linking to Pull Requests

1. **Code Changes**: If a documentation page describes code changes, link to the relevant pull request.
2. **New Features**: If a new feature is documented, link to the pull request that introduced the feature.
3. **Bug Fixes**: If a bug fix is documented, link to the pull request that resolved the issue.

## Examples

### Example 1: Cross-linking to an Issue

If a certain bug fix has documentation associated with it, you can link back to the issue for more context. For example:

- **Issue**: [#123](https://github.com/zarfld/LinuxCnc_PokeysLibComp/issues/123) - Fix for digital input not working
- **Documentation**: The digital input issue has been resolved in version 1.2.0. Refer to [Issue #123](https://github.com/zarfld/LinuxCnc_PokeysLibComp/issues/123) for more details.

### Example 2: Cross-linking to a Pull Request

If a new feature has been implemented, you can link back to the pull request that introduced the feature. For example:

- **Pull Request**: [#456](https://github.com/zarfld/LinuxCnc_PokeysLibComp/pull/456) - Added support for PoKeys57CNC
- **Documentation**: Support for PoKeys57CNC has been added in version 1.3.0. Refer to [Pull Request #456](https://github.com/zarfld/LinuxCnc_PokeysLibComp/pull/456) for more details.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Ensure that cross-links are consistent and follow a standard format.
- **Clarity**: Provide clear and concise descriptions for the cross-links.
- **Relevance**: Only cross-link to issues or pull requests that are directly relevant to the documentation.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that the documentation is well-organized and provides valuable context for users and contributors.
