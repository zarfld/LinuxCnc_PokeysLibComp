# Code Review Guidelines

## Expectations for Code Reviews

Code reviews are an essential part of our development process. They help ensure code quality, maintainability, and foster collaboration within the team. The following guidelines outline the expectations for code reviews:

1. **Code Style**: Adhere to the project's coding standards and style guidelines. Consistent code style makes the codebase easier to read and maintain.
2. **Documentation**: Ensure that code is well-documented. This includes inline comments, function/method documentation, and any necessary external documentation.
3. **Testing**: Verify that the code includes appropriate tests. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests.
4. **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of the code. Ensure that the code is efficient and does not introduce unnecessary performance bottlenecks.
5. **Security**: Review the code for potential security vulnerabilities. Ensure that the code follows best practices for security.

## Acceptable Pull Request (PR) Size and Complexity

To facilitate efficient code reviews, it is important to keep pull requests (PRs) manageable in size and complexity. The following guidelines outline what constitutes an acceptable PR size and complexity:

1. **PR Size**: Aim to keep PRs small and focused. A PR should ideally address a single issue or feature. Large PRs can be difficult to review and may introduce more bugs.
2. **PR Complexity**: Avoid introducing complex changes in a single PR. If a change is complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable PRs.

## Handling Conflicting Code or Suggestions

During code reviews, it is common to encounter conflicting code or suggestions. The following guidelines outline how to handle such situations:

1. **Conflicting Code**: If you encounter conflicting code, discuss the issue with the author and other relevant team members. Collaborate to find a solution that works for everyone.
2. **Suggestions**: Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvements. Be respectful and considerate in your feedback. Remember that the goal is to improve the code, not to criticize the author.

## Code Review Process

The following steps outline the code review process:

1. **Assign Reviewers**: Ensure that every PR has at least one assigned reviewer. Rotate reviewers to foster team-wide code familiarity.
2. **Automate Code Review Checks**: Integrate automated tools (e.g., linters, style checkers, and static analysis tools) into the CI/CD pipeline. Ensure code adheres to defined guidelines before requiring human review.
3. **Conduct Thorough Code Reviews**: Reviewers should focus on code correctness, adherence to coding standards and best practices, proper documentation, performance considerations, security implications, and proper test coverage.
4. **Collaborate on Changes**: Use inline comments in pull requests to suggest improvements. Encourage collaboration between the author and reviewer(s) to resolve issues.
5. **Set Clear Approval Criteria**: Define the minimum number of approvals required for a PR to be merged. Use GitHub’s protection rules to enforce these criteria.
6. **Facilitate Discussions and Knowledge Sharing**: Leverage the code review process to discuss architectural decisions, design patterns, or implementation strategies. Create a space for team members to share knowledge and learn from each other’s feedback.
7. **Track Review Progress**: Use GitHub’s tracking tools (e.g., issues, projects) to monitor the progress of code reviews. Ensure PRs are not left in review for too long without feedback or action.
8. **Merge Strategy**: Once all comments are resolved and the PR is approved, merge the changes following the team’s agreed-upon strategy (e.g., squash merge, rebase and merge).
9. **Post-Merge Collaboration**: After merging, encourage the team to continue monitoring the changes in the main branch for any issues or regressions. Encourage further discussion if the review process brought up important architectural or design questions.

## Branch Naming Conventions

To keep the repository organized, please follow these branch naming conventions:

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/{feature-name}`
- **Bug Fix Branches**: `bugfix/{bug-name}`
- **Improvement Branches**: `improvement/{improvement-name}`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/{hotfix-name}`

## Creating Separate Branches for Each Feature or Bug Fix

Each new feature or bug fix should have its own branch created from the latest version of the main branch. The branch should focus on one feature or issue to ensure isolated development.
